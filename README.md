# Security-Overview-of-QR-codes
# QR Code Security Scanner 

## 🚀 Overview  
QR codes are widely used in **digital payments, authentication, and marketing**, but they are also exploited for **phishing (QRishing), payment fraud, malware, and tracking risks**.  
This **terminal-based QR Code Security Scanner** detects **fraudulent, malicious, and privacy-invasive QR codes** using **AI-based fraud detection and API-driven threat analysis**.
<br>
## 🔹 Features  
✅ **Scan & Decode QR Codes** – Extract URLs, payment links, and text.  
✅ **Phishing & Malware Detection** – Uses **VirusTotal & Google Safe Browsing APIs**.  
✅ **AI-Based Fake Payment QR Detection** – Classifies real vs. fraudulent UPI/Paytm QR codes.  
✅ **Privacy Protection** – Detects tracking QR codes that collect user data.  
✅ **Cloud-Based Scan History (Firebase)** – Stores and retrieves past scan logs securely.  
<br>
## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Programming Language:** Python 🐍  
- **Libraries:** `opencv-python`, `pyzbar`, `requests`, `firebase-admin`, `scikit-learn`, `joblib`  
- **APIs:** VirusTotal API, Google Safe Browsing API  
- **Database:** Firebase Firestore (NoSQL)
